# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Brendan Lambert
**Date:** 25 Oct 25

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to create a GitHub repository.
- The importance of good documentation. 
- How to organize GitHub repos in an efficient manner.

## Challenges and Solutions
The biggest challenges with this assignment were ensuring updates were going into the correct repo and taking the time to ensure each step was completed effectively, being careful not to skip any steps. To solve the repo issue, I kept the assignment repo on the left side of my monitor, open to the readme page. I had a second tab for the assignment repo on the left side as well, in the event I had to do something outside of the readme, this ensured I didn't lose my place. I kept the new repo on the right side of the screen. This ensured all edits went to the correct repo. Additionally, keeping the assignment repo's readme open and untouched, ensured I didn't accidentially skip any steps.

## Connection to My GIS Career
My workplace has a dedicated software development team and they use a tool very similar to GitHub for all of their workflows. As I start experimenting with open source workflows, they will need to be included on this repository site with dev team's work. Once in this repository, it can go through the process to be added to our secure network. Understanding how GitHub and similar repositories work will enable a quick transition from school to work production.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
